# http://Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations
The website consists of 7 pages, including:
* A landing page containing: 
o An explanation of the project.
o Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot and clicking an image will take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages each with: 
o A descriptive title and heading tag.
o The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
o A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparison page that: 
o Contains all the visualizations on the same page.
o Used Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 
* The grid includes two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A data page that: 
o Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. 
* The table is a bootstrap table component.
* The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML or converting it to HTML. 
At the top of every page, the website has a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
